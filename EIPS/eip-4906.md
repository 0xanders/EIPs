## Abstract

This specification defines standard metadata update event of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md).
The proposal depends on and extends the existing [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md).

## Motivation

Many [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) contracts emit their custom event when metadata changed.
It is easy to update metadata of one NFT by specific event, but it is difficult for third-party platforms such as
NFT marketplace to update metadata of many NFTs based on custom events.

Having a standard `MetadataUpdate` event will make it easy for third-party platforms to timely update metadata of 
many NFTs.

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and
“OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

The **metadata update extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-721/ERC-1155 contracts.


```solidity
/// @title ERC-721/ERC-1155 Metadata Update Extension
interface IERC4906MetadataUpdate  {
    /// @dev This event emits when the metadata of a token is changed. 
    /// So that the third-party platforms such as NFT market could
    /// timely update the images and related attributes of the NFT
    event MetadataUpdate(uint256 indexed _tokenId);   
}
```

The `MetadataUpdate` event MUST be emitted when the metadata of a token is changed.

## Rationale

Different NFTs have different metadata, and metadata generally has multiple fields. `bytes data` could be used to 
represents the modified value of metadata.  It is difficult for third-party platforms to identify various types
of `bytes data`, so there is only one parameter `uint256 indexed _tokenId` in `MetadataUpdate` event. 

After capturing the `MetadataUpdate` event, a third party can update the metadata with information returned from 
the `tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId)` of ERC721 or `uri(uint256 _tokenId)` of ERC1155.

## Backwards Compatibility

No issues.
